Kindly see this post, prepared with a lot of effort. Surely you will find new insights on Linear regression   

This document will clearly explain the concept of #linearregression and #Stocastic GD and every step taken by the #gradient descend algorithm inside the simple linear regression.
Further, a program is developed to visualize how the parameters are changing inside the #sklearn LinearRegression model.

10/30/22, 19:00 - +91 98217 15290: Get through recorded session and practice on new datasets
10/30/22, 19:00 - +91 79855 54980: They don't have assignments for EDA ??
10/30/22, 19:01 - +91 79855 54980: And feature analysis

10/30/22, 19:20 - +44 7831 624309: I need a tip guys...the newer concept I learn I keep forgetting the old ones......is it just me ?? Not sure what the solution!!
10/30/22, 19:27 - +91 90636 71244: That happens to everyone. We just need to revise regularly until we get used to it.
10/30/22, 19:27 - +91 90636 71244: Don't leave anything after learning, you will forget.

10/31/22, 00:42 - +91 81785 68253: In what conditions should we balance an imbalanced dataset?

For performance metrics, we either rely on precision/recall value or we balance the dataset and then check for its accuracy.

I hope my question isn't confusing
10/31/22, 01:05 - Shobhandeb Paul: In any case, we need to balance the dataset, to get a good accuracy
10/31/22, 01:07 - Shobhandeb Paul: we may get an accuracy upto the mark, but the good practice is to balance the dataset perform scaling techniques, bring the data point closer to the best fit lines, and then perform all the performance metrics
10/31/22, 01:18 - +91 81785 68253: Alright, but my understanding is this:- we are eventually trying to improvise the over all performance of our model and there are some performance metrics based on which we can claim a model to be good or not. If without balancing the dataset I'm getting good accuracy, recall/precision values, will there be any need to balance the dataset the?
10/31/22, 01:19 - Shobhandeb Paul: what I said is u may be getting good accuracy, but the good practice is to balance the dataset and then proceed
10/31/22, 01:20 - Shobhandeb Paul: it happens sometimes, we do not balance the dataset, still we get accuracy 90+, sometimes it happens so, may be we're overfitting the dataset
10/31/22, 01:21 - Shobhandeb Paul: everything depends upon the type of dataset and way we approach
10/31/22, 01:22 - +91 81785 68253: Ideally, i believe this should be done but in order to balance my dataset I'll either have to oversample or undersample. Problem with my dataset is, it has roughly 80% invalid values in it and after removing all those records from dataset I'm left with 20% of the total dataset i.e. 4,000 records out of 30,000 records.
10/31/22, 01:22 - +91 81785 68253: Should I try balancing it?
10/31/22, 01:22 - Shobhandeb Paul: which dataset r u using?
10/31/22, 01:22 - +91 81785 68253: Credit Card Default prediction
10/31/22, 01:24 - Shobhandeb Paul: if the difference is too much, then do not balance, because in a credit card fraud detection, there may be unique cases, that's need to be taken into consideration, and should not treat as outliers although they are
10/31/22, 01:25 - +91 81785 68253: Would you mind connecting over a quick call now?

11/2/22, 23:42 - Shobhandeb Paul: Hey Guys, 
Solved the Wine Quality Dataset using SVC with 86% -- https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6993634875907944449/

Do review the work! :)
11/2/22, 23:42 - Subhash Dixit: I think 8:30 will be okay for everyone. Because many of us are working people
11/3/22, 00:25 - +91 88904 56326: I am in
11/3/22, 00:41 - +91 70206 63067: I have completed my b.tech in food Technology
11/3/22, 00:41 - +91 70206 63067: I found the topic relevant
11/3/22, 01:58 - +44 7831 624309: That's a good step moving forward. I can join too please.
11/3/22, 01:59 - +91 70206 63067: Can I join
11/3/22, 01:59 - +91 70206 63067: I just completed MongoDB from our course
11/3/22, 04:03 - Subhash Dixit: Can someone tell me what are the assumptions we take in SVC and SVR?
11/3/22, 06:58 - +91 91372 70261: üëç
11/3/22, 08:27 - +91 95959 59773: üëçüèª
11/3/22, 08:28 - +91 72062 13862: Done 8:00pm for all
11/3/22, 08:28 - +91 79855 54980: Yes
11/3/22, 08:40 - +91 79855 54980: Link üîó?
11/3/22, 09:05 - +91 96859 11215: When did this batch start?
11/3/22, 09:25 - Shivan @Ineuron YT Creatoy: Friday
11/3/22, 09:32 - +91 96859 11215: ?
11/3/22, 09:33 - +91 96859 11215: I mean the course start date
11/3/22, 09:58 - Shivan @Ineuron YT Creatoy: It's a free session, 2-3 days in a week.
11/3/22, 10:25 - Shobhandeb Paul: In both the cases, the data points near the best fit line will matter the accuracy of the model. For SVC , the classification matrix will give the result of the trained model, as it is a classification model and for SVR, the MAE, MSE or RMSE, will give the info, how well the model is trained, as this is a regression problem.

For increasing the accuracy, u can use the hyperparameter tuning methods, or identify the outliers, and decide whether to remove or not, depending upon the dataset, or drop the less correlated columns, 

if this doesn't answer your question, revert back please
11/3/22, 10:28 - Subhash Dixit: If we are use sampling techniques, do we need to remove outliers or transformed the right skewed and left skewed data into normal distribution? I have tried all these and found only with sampling accuracy are more.
11/3/22, 10:30 - Shobhandeb Paul: see u cannot specify a particular method, it all depends on the type of dataset you are using,
11/3/22, 10:31 - Shobhandeb Paul: sometimes it will happen so, you're getting a good accuracy with sampling or applying any scaling methods, that depends
11/3/22, 10:31 - Subhash Dixit: Yup that is correct but usually we do this preprocessing that's why I asked
11/3/22, 10:32 - Subhash Dixit: Yeah got it. Thanks
11/3/22, 10:32 - Shobhandeb Paul: yeah sure sure, not a problem
11/3/22, 10:35 - +91 96859 11215: I am asking about the FSDS 2.0 course not the community session being planned
11/3/22, 10:36 - +91 96859 11215: Where are you guys currently in the course?

11/3/22, 23:15 - +91 86178 08574: Hi guys
11/3/22, 23:16 - +91 86178 08574: for the wine quality dataset, what's the best accuracy you got using SVC
11/3/22, 23:51 - Shobhandeb Paul: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6993634875907944449/

86%
11/3/22, 23:56 - +91 86178 08574: cool
11/3/22, 23:57 - +91 86178 08574: I see you did log transformation on the dataset
11/3/22, 23:57 - +91 86178 08574: was that to deal with the outliers?
11/4/22, 00:14 - Subhash Dixit: Log transformation is for converting right skewed or left skewed data to normal distribution
11/4/22, 00:16 - Subhash Dixit: Can someone tell me if the features are highly positively or negatively correlated with the target variable then it is good, right? And if the features are highly correlated among themselves then it is bad,right?
11/4/22, 00:16 - Subhash Dixit: In regression problem
11/4/22, 00:17 - +91 86178 08574: if the features are highly correlated among themselves then basically they behave like one feature
11/4/22, 00:17 - +91 86178 08574: so its better to drop one of them
11/4/22, 00:18 - Subhash Dixit: Is my understanding is correct wrt to target variable?
11/4/22, 00:19 - +91 95563 32113: Let me correct you my friend
Log transformation of only for right skewed
11/4/22, 00:19 - +91 86178 08574: yes
11/4/22, 00:20 - Subhash Dixit: Oh! Thanks for the correction. Please let me know how to convert left skewed data to normal distribution?
11/4/22, 00:20 - Subhash Dixit: Thanks
11/4/22, 00:22 - +91 95563 32113: In terms of coding you can apply box-cox transformation
Which will converter a distribution to normal if it is not normally distributed
11/4/22, 00:24 - Subhash Dixit: Box Cox is applicable for right and left skewed both? Or only for left skewed?
11/4/22, 00:25 - +91 86178 08574: whats the benifit of making the data normally distributed?
11/4/22, 00:25 - +91 86178 08574: aren't we messing with the original data
11/4/22, 00:25 - +91 95563 32113: Log transformation is applicable to only Right skewed
Box-cox to any distribution which are not normally distributed
11/4/22, 00:26 - +91 95563 32113: It's not about messing and all
11/4/22, 00:27 - +91 95563 32113: If our dataset is Normandy distributed then we can apply most of the statistical formals over it and get the insight. But in case of others it's very difficult
11/4/22, 00:28 - +91 95563 32113: And in transformation we're only changing the distribution to another form
That's it
11/4/22, 00:29 - +91 86178 08574: yes but we're applying a function over the dataset, which changes the values itself isn't
11/4/22, 00:30 - +91 86178 08574: in case of scaling dataset using transform and fit transform... we just scale down the values, the relationship between all the data points still remains the same
11/4/22, 00:30 - +91 86178 08574: so I understand why this works
11/4/22, 00:32 - +91 95563 32113: Yes we're changing the value with respect to the central point for all the features to get our job done(insight)

For more clarity over the concept please refer Google

11/5/22, 13:57 - Shobhandeb Paul: using pandas [ ] , loc and iloc
11/5/22, 13:58 - Shobhandeb Paul: did you scale the values?
11/5/22, 13:58 - Shobhandeb Paul: after deleting the features, or check if anyone of the column requires, labelencoding?
11/5/22, 14:15 - Subhash Dixit: No, scaling will be done after deleting features, right?Actually features are highly correlated..Out of 6-7 features after applying VIf only two will be left.
11/5/22, 14:15 - Subhash Dixit: No features requires encoding
11/5/22, 14:30 - Shobhandeb Paul: okay okay, I thought it in the other way
11/5/22, 14:31 - Subhash Dixit: Yes, will ask today to Krish sir. If after applying VIF only two features will be left out of 7 then what to do
11/5/22, 15:05 - Shobhandeb Paul: the class hasn't started yet, right?

11/6/22, 11:35 - +91 90042 57538: you have to use axis=1, inplace=True
11/6/22, 11:35 - +91 89683 53918: Already did but still getting error
11/6/22, 11:36 - +91 90042 57538: check you dataset if that column is still there or not
11/6/22, 11:36 - +91 89683 53918: Column is not there
11/6/22, 11:36 - +91 90042 57538: then it removed already
11/6/22, 11:37 - +91 90042 57538: when droping you delete it permentaly

11/6/22, 11:42 - +91 89683 53918: And then checked dataset, columns were not there
11/6/22, 11:42 - +91 89683 53918: But now when doing in place=true, its showing error
11/6/22, 11:43 - +91 81307 87637: Yeah it is now gone from your original dataset
11/6/22, 11:43 - +91 90042 57538: maybe you this first
11/6/22, 11:44 - +91 90042 57538: then you try to drop it temporary
11/6/22, 11:44 - +91 81307 87637: Yeah
11/6/22, 11:44 - +91 81307 87637: Reload dataset and try again
11/6/22, 11:44 - +91 89683 53918: Ok
11/6/22, 11:44 - +91 90042 57538: yes try to rerun
11/6/22, 11:45 - +91 89683 53918: So have to load again csv file again?

11/6/22, 12:10 - Subhash Dixit: If I am getting 100 % accuracy for test and training set, is it okay? Or Do I need to change anything?
11/6/22, 12:17 - Shobhandeb Paul: check if the model is overfitted
11/6/22, 12:19 - Subhash Dixit: Test and train accuracy both are 100% it means a general model right?
11/6/22, 12:19 - Shobhandeb Paul: not necessary
11/6/22, 12:19 - Shobhandeb Paul: sometimes, model may be overfitted
11/6/22, 12:20 - Subhash Dixit: Then how to check overfitted model other tha by checking with accuracy

11/6/22, 17:45 - Subhash Dixit: In linear regression, when accuracy is about 90 % for test and train but MSE and MAE values are very high? What can we do?
11/6/22, 18:51 - Shobhandeb Paul: What abt R2 score?
11/6/22, 18:51 - Shobhandeb Paul: it is very low, or good?
11/6/22, 18:51 - Shivan @Ineuron YT Creatoy: https://youtu.be/I4kzVhm8MRQ
11/6/22, 18:53 - Shobhandeb Paul: Remove outliers in the data
Do feature selection, some of features may not be as informative.
Try to combine some features to make it more meaningful e.g. ratio of some feature may be more meaningful than individual features to predict price.
Maybe the linear regression is under fitting or over fitting the data you can check ROC curve and try to use more complex model like polynomial regression or regularization respectively
11/6/22, 19:45 - Subhash Dixit: Good..90%
11/6/22, 19:46 - Shobhandeb Paul: follow these steps
11/6/22, 19:47 - Subhash Dixit: Few of these steps has been done already...will try to do more feature engineering
11/6/22, 19:47 - Subhash Dixit: Yes will try...Thabks
11/6/22, 19:47 - Shobhandeb Paul: exactly, orelse, I don't see any more ways, uptill now
11/6/22, 19:57 - +91 90636 71244: Guys, did sir give any assignment today??
11/6/22, 19:58 - Shobhandeb Paul: yes
11/6/22, 20:02 - Subhash Dixit: Yes...But I have to improve by any means because cost function values are very awkward
11/6/22, 20:03 - Shobhandeb Paul: awkward, like?

11/24/22, 20:09 - +91 97168 98919: Have you ever visualised how any model overfits or underfits the dataset?
Or are you confused to understand what is underfitting or overfitting?
Or how the overfitting model is a complex model and the underfitting model a simple model?
Or what is the Bias variance tradeoff?

This article will give you answer to the above questions, not just theoretically but also practically, and it will clear your doubt about overfitting, underfitting and bias-variance tradeoff.

12/2/22, 15:29 - +91 96404 90672: Guys ,while building classification model in end to end projects are we supposed impliment every possible model Like  Logistic regression,SVM,Randomforest, Xgboost, etc... and compare them ?
12/2/22, 15:33 - +91 81785 68253: I've got this same question too
12/2/22, 15:33 - +91 93903 94878: Yes
12/2/22, 16:02 - +91 98610 45001: Yes, you will have to choose the model which will give higher accuracy
12/2/22, 16:22 - +91 79997 44064: Do any one know...how to fetch html page's  h1 attribute text in python

12/2/22, 17:01 - +91 98675 46451: Not necessarily although that'll be definitely better, but i feel you can eliminate few algos which you feel will perform less than the other for example logistic will obviously perform lesser than randomforest

12/4/22, 19:08 - +91 81785 68253: Does anybody think the way Avnish is explaining things to us, that's sufficiently understandable? I'm having a hard time understanding the project.
12/4/22, 19:08 - Subhash Dixit: Obviously no
12/4/22, 19:10 - +91 81785 68253: If a get the similar response from a couple of more people then I'll have to drop it to the iNeuron team. I believe they will handle it maturely.
12/4/22, 19:13 - Subhash Dixit: They will not do anything
12/4/22, 19:13 - Subhash Dixit: Krish sir should teach
12/4/22, 19:14 - +91 81785 68253: They definitely won't if we don't flag it
12/4/22, 19:15 - +91 95813 88411: Agree Not sufficient
12/4/22, 19:15 - Subhash Dixit: I have already sent multiple emails and they didn't reoly
12/4/22, 19:15 - +91 95813 88411: Even I also send mail but no response
12/4/22, 19:16 - Shobhandeb Paul: they dont have any other option, rather than to re record the session
12/4/22, 19:16 - +91 98250 15084: i have also send mail
12/4/22, 19:16 - Shobhandeb Paul: or take extra class
12/4/22, 19:17 - +91 98250 15084: bt they are not giving satisfactory reply
12/4/22, 19:17 - Subhash Dixit: Krish sir should take extra class
12/4/22, 19:17 - Shobhandeb Paul: that's y they wont do it
12/4/22, 19:17 - Shobhandeb Paul: bolna pdega milke
12/4/22, 19:17 - Shobhandeb Paul: ek grp mail kro
12/4/22, 19:18 - +91 81785 68253: Were those email regarding the same issue related to Avnish?
12/4/22, 19:18 - +91 81785 68253: Sunny was indeed way better
12/4/22, 19:19 - +91 99227 66661: Have you guys tried seeing those recordings at lesser speeds ?
12/4/22, 19:19 - +91 81785 68253: I did, but that too didn't help. I eventually had to rely on Google most of the time
12/4/22, 19:20 - +91 81785 68253: Anyways I'm dropping an email to Divyanshu regarding this. I hope to hear from him soon with a solution
12/4/22, 19:21 - +91 89995 47341 joined using this group's invite link
12/4/22, 19:22 - +91 89995 47341: Hi komal from this side,

Just now I heard from Sahil that you too are facing a problem to understand the project.
So we should get united and drop a mail to Krish sir, sudhanshu sir...

Otherwise things won't change and it will be just a waste of our time. 
We can't compromise with our time at this stage.
What do you all say???
12/4/22, 19:23 - +91 81785 68253: Agreed. And in case they don't listen(which i doubt will happen) I've got a workaround.

We can start flagging it over the emails and wait for a few days
12/4/22, 19:24 - +91 86178 08574: The hands on being done correctly according to me, there should have been knowledge check or coding assignment after every session to improve the understanding
12/4/22, 19:24 - +91 89995 47341: Yeah what we can do is rather than mailing individually
We can take all our e-mail IDs and send one mail..

They can ignore individuals mail but can't ignore group mail.
12/4/22, 19:25 - +91 86178 08574: not being done correctly*
12/4/22, 19:25 - +91 86178 08574: +1
12/4/22, 19:25 - Subhash Dixit: Yes
12/4/22, 19:26 - Subhash Dixit: He is better..
12/4/22, 19:26 - +91 89995 47341: Tbh, there are still many who do have problems with sunny too.
12/4/22, 19:27 - +91 99875 64492: lets drop a mail with same subject line
12/4/22, 19:27 - +91 99227 66661: When will they complete the project ?
12/4/22, 19:27 - +91 89995 47341: We paid because Krish sir and sudhanshu sir were going to teach us. But now the scenario is quite different .
12/4/22, 19:28 - Subhash Dixit: But he keeps explaining till we understand
12/4/22, 19:28 - +91 99875 64492: Exactly that's what i am saying from last 3-4 weeks
12/4/22, 19:28 - +91 79855 54980: He left ineuron
12/4/22, 19:28 - +91 89995 47341: That's great
12/4/22, 19:28 - +91 99875 64492: he was present yesterday
12/4/22, 19:29 - +91 90042 57538: Even today also
12/4/22, 19:29 - +91 81785 68253: Because of that reason we can't compromise with our learning. We understand that but can't really compromise
12/4/22, 19:29 - +91 79855 54980: May be serving notice period üòê
12/4/22, 19:30 - +91 79755 70668: Can we all raise this in the class time when Krish is there
12/4/22, 19:30 - +91 97168 98919: That is sunny bhaveen chandra, who left iNeuron.
12/4/22, 19:30 - +91 89995 47341: Sure definitely but he should look into that
Otherwise he easily ignores everything
12/4/22, 19:30 - +91 79855 54980: When it comes to prectical topics they do like that .. 
Same will be done when it come with computer vision ... 
I have seen previous videos in deep learning course ...
12/4/22, 19:31 - +91 79855 54980: Yes .. he left
12/4/22, 19:31 - Subhash Dixit: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 19:31 - +91 79855 54980: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 19:32 - +91 79855 54980: This is LinkedIn page of sunny bhaveen Chandra
12/4/22, 19:33 - +91 99875 64492: he is not present from start of the course, Sunny Savita teaches for this course sometimes
12/4/22, 19:33 - +91 79855 54980: Sudhanshu and Krish .. only teach theoretical concepts .. when it comes to project and other things .. it get shifted to other mentors
12/4/22, 19:34 - +91 89995 47341: Anyhow the sunny which is mentioned here is not in iNeuron now
12/4/22, 19:34 - +91 79755 70668: Yes we can request like we are not able to understand , I think this approach may help us when we raise this to Krish. Krish can't take atleast   Sunny should take our session bcoz we are adjusted to his wavelength
12/4/22, 19:34 - Shobhandeb Paul: somebody write mail, wnd and attach our consent for the problem
12/4/22, 19:35 - Subhash Dixit: Acha
12/4/22, 19:36 - +91 79855 54980: Yes
12/4/22, 19:39 - +91 97168 98919: He would be teaching us AI and Deep learning.
12/4/22, 19:40 - +91 89995 47341: Seriously?
12/4/22, 19:41 - +60 11-2419 2738: üòÑwe are gone.
12/4/22, 19:42 - +91 79855 54980: ü§£ü§£ he left the institute bro
12/4/22, 19:42 - +91 90042 57538: I think code wise we are able to understand, maybe because he fumbled while talking most of us are facing issue but I think if we re-watch few more time it's good to understand, I'm also facing issue while remembering all steps...like how many file we need to create and components and all things...but for this things I don't they will change the mentor...this is what I think
12/4/22, 19:42 - Shobhandeb Paul: happily üòÄ
12/4/22, 19:44 - +91 89995 47341: How many times should we watch ???
12/4/22, 19:44 - Subhash Dixit: They should provide some notes in a sequential manner where all the description about filles will be there so that we can read and understand
12/4/22, 19:45 - Shobhandeb Paul: exactly my point
12/4/22, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: Yes we can ask for that
12/4/22, 19:45 - +91 79855 54980: More importantly 
. 
In Deep learning .. ANN and CNN is entirely taken by sunny .. he left .. 
So don't know who will fill in
12/4/22, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: This is possible
12/4/22, 19:45 - +91 90042 57538: But changing mentor I don't think...
12/4/22, 19:45 - Shobhandeb Paul: Lets see what happens then we raise concern
12/4/22, 19:46 - Shobhandeb Paul: btw who is writing the mail, please mention
12/4/22, 19:46 - Shobhandeb Paul: this
12/4/22, 19:46 - Shobhandeb Paul: atleast that will b handy, easy to take on
12/4/22, 19:48 - +91 99875 64492: My suggestion is write a mail with same subject line to Krish and sudhanshu....
12/4/22, 19:57 - +91 81785 68253: +1
12/4/22, 19:58 - +91 98250 15084: +1  
Same subject and same messege
12/4/22, 19:58 - +91 75880 03618: Yes
12/4/22, 19:58 - +91 98250 15084: and this time when they send mail for live class feedback . 
at that time also . give then 1 stars
12/4/22, 19:59 - +91 98250 15084: this will definately reach to there ears
12/4/22, 20:01 - +60 11-2419 2738: Yes
12/4/22, 20:03 - +91 95959 59773: As far concern Avnish,I think he is giving his 100%. He is hardcoding everything in modular way with MLOps.Initially I also find it difficult to understand because didn't practice OOPs and file handling.
12/4/22, 20:04 - +60 11-2419 2738: File handling  Class date?
12/4/22, 20:05 - +91 95959 59773: I will suggest go through CampusX channel for python and ML.You will definitely not find any difficulty in OOPs.
12/4/22, 20:09 - +91 95959 59773: I didn't find it in dashboard right now. But it was there in one of session .
12/4/22, 20:09 - +91 89995 47341: With huge respect to you aniket,
Just tell me one thing why we paid 17k to iNeuron???
12/4/22, 20:09 - +91 81785 68253: See that's where the problem lies. With Sudhanshu, Krish and Sunny we didn't have to read anything extra. So now we have spare some extra time to understand what he explained in 3 hour long session
12/4/22, 20:10 - +91 81785 68253: As soon as I'm dropping an email, I'll share the subject line here
12/4/22, 20:10 - +91 89995 47341: Sure
12/4/22, 20:11 - +60 11-2419 2738: Plz share subject line and mail body you write.
12/4/22, 20:15 - +91 95959 59773: Guys they have taken theoretical concept and Avnish is taking practical concept which is kind of pro level with MLOps.We have to practice more.For MLOps lectures are there on dashboard.Go through it.
12/4/22, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: Aniket ..if you understand it.. then it fine.. 

Bt we have also paid.. 
And they should teach like everybody should understand..
12/4/22, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: It is not about 1-2 students..
12/4/22, 20:16 - +91 98250 15084: Every student of may 2022 batch should understand..
12/4/22, 20:17 - +91 98250 15084: And they should not go to next topic untill each and every student has the whole concept clear in mind.
12/4/22, 20:17 - +91 90042 57538: What you are not understanding??
12/4/22, 20:18 - +91 89995 47341: Exactly
12/4/22, 20:18 - +91 98250 15084: Project part from day 2..
12/4/22, 20:18 - +91 95959 59773: Guys it all about OOPs.Can we ask to take it again?
12/4/22, 20:18 - +91 90042 57538: Coding wise?
12/4/22, 20:19 - +91 98250 15084: Yes
12/4/22, 20:19 - +91 95959 59773: https://youtu.be/Trvqq5w7-0Q
12/4/22, 20:20 - +91 95959 59773: Go through this plyalist
12/4/22, 20:21 - +91 95959 59773: It might help
12/4/22, 20:21 - +91 95959 59773: This is free
12/4/22, 20:21 - +44 7831 624309: It's 799/month if we have to enroll
12/4/22, 20:22 - +91 95959 59773: If we need mentorship
12/4/22, 20:23 - +91 95959 59773: Your all doubt related to Avnish coding will get resolved once you go through it.
12/4/22, 21:05 - +91 79755 70668: Thank u Ankit.
12/4/22, 21:11 - +91 81785 68253: What's the email ID of divyanshu and Krish can someone please share?
12/4/22, 21:23 - +91 89995 47341: sudhanshu@ineuron.ai
krish.naik@ineuron.ai
12/4/22, 21:40 - +91 81785 68253: Mail sent to them with subject line *"[Urgent] Concern regarding live classes"*
12/4/22, 21:52 - +91 98250 15084: What is written in content.. ?
12/4/22, 21:54 - +91 81785 68253: I just mentioned that I'm unable to understand whatever Avnish is explaining and the same is other's experience too. So they may let Sunny take the sessions
12/4/22, 21:56 - +91 98250 15084: Okk.. 
I also send same mail
12/4/22, 21:56 - +91 81785 68253: Perfect üëçüèª
12/4/22, 22:14 - +91 90129 22002: But Avanish is project expert that's why he is taking classes, as told by Krish sir himself in the beginning of project. If sunny could, they wouldn't have call Avanish.
12/4/22, 22:16 - +91 81785 68253: That might be but my job was to make them aware of the problem that I'm facing at first. I can have a discussion with them if they are up for it and accordingly come to a conclusion
12/4/22, 22:18 - +91 90129 22002: You guys also want it to be industry standard. So I think it requires little extra effort. I am also facing the difficulty but i know only i need to pay more attention and put some more efforts
12/4/22, 22:20 - +91 81785 68253: Industry standard? Sorry i didn't get that
12/4/22, 22:21 - +91 79997 44064: +1
12/4/22, 22:22 - +91 98250 15084: +1
12/4/22, 22:22 - +91 90129 22002: This is just replication of real problem and when it comes to the real scenario things may be more complex and tougher. Why don't you start thinking like you are dealing with some real problem and you have to deal with it instead of blaming and other things
12/4/22, 22:24 - +91 90129 22002: The level of work you have to do after joining
12/4/22, 22:25 - +91 81785 68253: Makes sense but the question that i have for myself now is "Should i spend my time on these live classes anymore or not?". Because the expectations from the day 1 had been set that the content being delivered in these classes is sufficient enough and there is no need to go through anything else. So far things were going well, now it took a downturn from last week which is not justified according to me.
12/4/22, 22:26 - +91 81785 68253: Before that we need to understand the basics. If I'm unable to understand the flow of execution, how can i build a project?
12/4/22, 22:28 - +91 98250 15084: right
12/4/22, 22:28 - +91 90129 22002: It will take time, so better to give yourself some time to digest these things
12/4/22, 22:28 - +91 90042 57538: +1
12/4/22, 22:30 - +91 90129 22002: Try to remember when you started learning python. Initially we didn't get anything but slowly our grip getting tighter and tighter
12/4/22, 22:31 - +91 90129 22002: And when you go back after some time, then you realise how easy it was.
12/4/22, 22:31 - +91 95952 53520: 90+ % people not understand Avnish code
12/4/22, 22:32 - +91 90042 57538: No they are facing issue regarding to explanation
12/4/22, 22:32 - +91 90042 57538: Few of them have problem with code
12/4/22, 22:33 - +91 95952 53520: Yes.... Explanation
12/4/22, 22:33 - +91 90129 22002: What if this is the reality of work you are going to do or what people expect you to do?
12/4/22, 22:34 - +91 95959 59773: I will suggest go through the ML project session taken by Sudhanshu sir that are available on dashboard.
12/4/22, 22:34 - +91 95959 59773: There is no excuse for hardwork
12/4/22, 22:35 - +91 81785 68253: Initially i was able to understand things with great ease. Also we knew it that we were in the right hands. I've been watching Krish videos from a long time and that's where that trust was developed.

Speaking of giving more time, i honestly have less time for experimentations. Most of us are working and time is valuable for us.
Let's say 1 month down the line we could not understand anything at all. This 1 month of time will be go in vain.
12/4/22, 22:36 - +91 81785 68253: Problem is with the explanation, not with the code i guess.
12/4/22, 22:37 - +91 81785 68253: I think you currently are working in tech role? Please correct me if I'm wrong
12/4/22, 22:39 - +91 90129 22002: I have gone through last year ml project recordings, only explanation was there code was written already.
12/4/22, 22:40 - +91 81785 68253: That might help as i believe understanding the concept is more important
12/4/22, 22:40 - +91 90129 22002: I think this is great opportunity for us to see how they use to write code.
12/4/22, 22:40 - +91 90129 22002: No I'm student only
12/5/22, 00:18 - +91 79855 54980: Just by seeing .. we might feel ok .. at that point but going ahead .. when v have to do it by ourselves.. we will get stuck

12/5/22, 22:00 - +91 98250 15084: My feedback of live class..
12/5/22, 22:15 - +91 99397 90052: Yes it is true.
12/5/22, 22:18 - +91 98182 66826: Totally Agree with this. Same feeling bro. Every working professional is short of spare time, very hard to manage work time, along with family and study things at the same time as they are going on.. Even I am now feeling cornered for the zeal of my transition.. till python, everything was going smooth and great. Starting ML, everything got mixed up..
12/5/22, 22:25 - +91 99397 90052: We have to study prepared by our own then only it's helpful. Even in explaining/teaching also very very fast and hurriedly they want to finish if we learnt or not. This is what I am feeling and experiencing in ineuron sir.
12/5/22, 22:27 - +91 98250 15084: Plz write all this in feedback form..
12/5/22, 22:28 - +91 98182 66826: Y v hv paid. When we had to study by own. Courses available there at YouTube. Just watch and prepare urself. Please don't mind, take it in a healthy manner.
12/5/22, 22:29 - +91 98182 66826: Not much difference than school then, it means. They also teach fast and in hurry and we have to prepare us by self
12/5/22, 22:39 - +91 97168 98919: See, while constructing a building important thing is the foundation and pillars. Building the walls are other things are relatively easy, though time taking but are easy.  Foundation of python and ML is  been laid down by the Sudhanshu and Krish naik. Now rest of the things are easy and need to be done on our own. 

See, you need to come out of this mind makeup like every line of code needs to run and executed in front of you and when everyone understands then write another line of code. If this is the case then whats the use to invest 6 months in learning python code. And with this speed even a year would be less for you to complete the project. 

I am not advocating the iNeuron but things are not that difficult. 

Yes understanding the codes are difficult and for that you need to sit and watch.
12/5/22, 22:46 - +91 97168 98919: See, first self study is key to success, eventually, you have to read on your own. If you are not doing self study, even 100 times krish will explain every thing still there are chances that will miss one or more concepts. 

If you have numbers from 1 to 100 in your course then whats the use going beyond 100. And you learn those numbers very fast then how can you say that are teaching very very fast. See they can go on repeating same concept 4 - 5 times in a class. Thats not feasible. 

So better do self study. Just my suggestion
12/5/22, 22:48 - +91 99397 90052: Yes. That's what I have been following.
12/5/22, 22:48 - +91 90042 57538: Follow what sunny sir told us in today's class

12/9/22, 23:47 - Subhash Dixit: Can we consider our model to be general if differences between test and train accuracy (adjusted r squared) is 6%? Traini accuracy: 96 and test accuracy : 90
12/10/22, 00:57 - +91 81785 68253: I think it's general, 6% isn't much

12/22/22, 18:26 - +91 90218 58584: If they ain't providing job guarantee they should atleast provide job assistance stuff like mock interviews
12/22/22, 18:27 - +91 79755 70668: So this is the reason Krish is not taking our ML classes üòê
12/22/22, 18:28 - +91 97309 42181: Bhai L lag gaye fir,
12/22/22, 18:28 - +91 97309 42181: Refund chahiye hoga fir

.
12/22/22, 18:31 - +91 90218 58584: We should ask them whether job guarantee is there for ongoing batches
12/22/22, 18:31 - +91 90218 58584: Also our internship
12/22/22, 18:32 - +91 90218 58584: Is Krish Naik teaching in ML recorded videos?
12/22/22, 18:34 - +91 77081 21800: May be it's for upcoming batches or they might provide an alternative service i guess
12/22/22, 18:34 - +91 90218 58584: Yeah
12/22/22, 18:35 - +91 79755 70668: I could see only Sunny has taken the classes.  Anyone in group can confirm..
12/22/22, 18:35 - +91 90218 58584: Okay
12/22/22, 18:41 - +91 95952 53520: Bhai refund chhoda.... Jo itna time gaya hai.......7 to 8  month
12/22/22, 18:42 - +91 99675 57017: Current batch ke liye job guarantee program hai
12/22/22, 18:42 - +91 95952 53520: Ek to Career Non IT to IT aane ke liye fsds join kiya tha
12/22/22, 18:42 - +91 99675 57017: Upcoming batches ke liye nhi hoga

12/22/22, 18:50 - +91 96859 11215: This article is worded wrong. 100% of S. Chand's stake is sold to PW. 
It's a minority 6% stake they have in iNeuron
12/22/22, 18:50 - +91 96859 11215: Alsoa i don't think existing programs won't have any change in their terms so no need to panick
12/22/22, 18:52 - +91 79755 70668: I just now check the Discord and it is mentioned as Ineuron merger with PW
12/22/22, 18:54 - +91 79755 70668: No need to panic. I hope we will get the content what they have promised

12/22/22, 18:55 - +91 79755 70668: If anyone is joining today Class then anyone can confirm in the class itself
12/22/22, 20:04 - +91 79855 54980: Par ye sab merger ka jarurat kya ta .. 
Mast to chal raha ta ineuron ..
12/22/22, 20:05 - +91 90042 57538: Teachers gareeb ho rahe hai
12/22/22, 20:05 - +91 90042 57538: Isliye
12/22/22, 20:06 - +91 90042 57538: null
12/22/22, 20:08 - +91 90218 58584: It's just that S Chand has invested 7 crore in Ineuron  December 2021 that is 6% of total stake 
And sold that stake to PW now for 14 crores
So ineuron got a new and big investor that is PW
12/22/22, 20:10 - +91 90042 57538: Just hope for they do not remove all the facilities they provided till now
12/22/22, 20:10 - +91 90042 57538: Baki yarr karo kuch bhi
12/22/22, 20:10 - +91 90218 58584: Last time also merger happened between LCO of Hitesh Sir and Ineuron
12/22/22, 20:10 - +91 90218 58584: In April or May 2022

12/22/22, 20:13 - Shobhandeb Paul: See iNeuron provided us a lifetime course material along with live classes, we cannot deny the fact.

Moreover, why are pre-assuming that there is no job guarantee for our batch?

We should focus on building our skills, as the recorded content is good on the provided cost, also not neglecting the fact that, many of us doesn't know basic things, as we depend on spoon feeding and depends on them
12/22/22, 20:17 - Shobhandeb Paul: at the end of the day, everyone's target is good takeaway, so y dont they?
12/22/22, 20:32 - +91 90218 58584: Yes we should truly be grateful for the quality and quantity of content we are getting from Ineuron for such affordable price. 

In April I had applied for internship at some company and they reverted back with a NLP assignment but that time l couldn't solve it as I didn't even have a programming background.
When l joined Ineuron l saw that same assignement project in the dashboard 
So l was glad that l came to the right place
12/22/22, 20:33 - Shobhandeb Paul: Those who are joining today's class, take a clarification abt the job guarantee we'all are worried abt,
12/22/22, 20:33 - Shobhandeb Paul: one shot all will be cleared
12/22/22, 20:33 - +91 90218 58584: Do this as top priority guys thanks

12/26/22, 20:51 - +91 88904 56326: Can anyone help help me with that
12/26/22, 20:52 - +91 79855 54980: Basic Python
SQL 
Statistics
Basic excel 
EDA 
Power Bi / Tableau.. 

Storytelling
12/26/22, 20:52 - +91 88904 56326: Okay do you have recommendation for statistic book
12/26/22, 20:54 - +91 79855 54980: No.. 
But if u r from FSDS batch 
. Just go through the entire stats part from previous recorded sessions.. 
Or watch out the entire Krish playlist on YouTube on statistics.. that will be best to start with..
12/26/22, 20:56 - +91 79855 54980: Also learn a gud amount of probability also ..
12/26/22, 21:11 - +91 88904 56326: Okay

Damn nice
12/27/22, 03:09 - +91 99397 90052: Really wonderful for DS
12/27/22, 03:10 - +91 90218 58584: üòÇ we are getting IIT's course of data science for free
12/27/22, 03:10 - +91 99397 90052: Yes definitely
12/27/22, 03:14 - +91 99397 90052: With this(IIT Madrass statistics )  learning on power BI is very helpful. These two are very good combinations I found.

12/27/22, 13:29 - +91 93719 83850: Using neurolab, the address localhost:portno will not work. Localhost needs to be replaced by your lab's url followed by port no. Something like this- url.ineuron.app:5000
12/27/22, 13:32 - Subhash Dixit: Thanks bro. I will try this.

12/27/22, 20:24 - +91 76088 83617: Correct the spelling 
apache-airflow
12/27/22, 20:31 - +91 98111 07575: üßê much appreciated!! It worked..
12/27/22, 23:10 - +91 81785 68253: Did anyone tuned hyper parameters of VotingClassifier using RandomSearchCV?
It may sound strange but It's not taking more than 10 key value pairs of parameters.
12/28/22, 00:47 - Shobhandeb Paul: can you share screenshot for the same
12/28/22, 00:49 - +91 81785 68253: It was throwing some ValueError without exact message. The moment i remove a few parameters, it worked fine. Ill share the screenshot tomorrow but that may not be helpful
12/28/22, 00:51 - Shobhandeb Paul: okay, inbox me the ss
12/28/22, 00:52 - Shobhandeb Paul: then we can discuss the same

12/28/22, 09:52 - +91 93719 83850: Type extension is used to define data type annotations in python. It has nothing to do with parameter tuning. Also in line 8 and 9 you are reading CSV and doing profiling. You are not using type annotations here. You can delete imports at line 3,4,5.

12/28/22, 18:35 - +91 99379 99162: Check space after dot

12/28/22, 18:41 - +91 99227 66661: so what should I do ?
12/28/22, 18:44 - +91 99379 99162: Sorry I don't know.
 Once I was facing the same issue but it was resolved  by removing space.
12/28/22, 18:45 - +91 99227 66661: oh ok
12/28/22, 18:48 - +91 99227 66661: @919937999162 solved the problem

12/31/22, 22:06 - +91 81785 68253: Have you checked user.email and user.name? Most likely this happens when these variables are not set
12/31/22, 22:09 - +91 81785 68253: Did this happen with anyone that you created a new feature which has 15% correlation with output feature, yet it's not contributing in accuracy?

This seems strange to me. Any help in this regards is appreciated.

Happy New Year üòå
12/31/22, 22:14 - +91 90042 57538: Both are correct I guess
12/31/22, 22:16 - +91 81785 68253: Ummm not really what's wrong here. As far as i call recall, i came across probably the same error once. I reset the variables and it started working. Not sure if it's gonna work this time
12/31/22, 23:02 - +91 93719 83850: Try to check if you are using https method or SSH method to authenticate. I think with SSH you need personal access token.

I need some help related to a project.

Thanks already
1/6/23, 22:13 - Subhash Dixit: Did any use apache airflow from AWS? I have deployed successfully but not able to open Airflow
1/6/23, 22:14 - Subhash Dixit: I can't create larger machine.  Any solution will be highly highly appreciated
1/6/23, 22:19 - +91 93719 83850: There is a way to run it locally but it needs a lot of configuration changes for docker image, authentication, etc. I am trying to do it but not there yet.
1/6/23, 22:21 - Subhash Dixit: Okay bro I can't do lots of changes. I am still not confident with the project code. How they are opening by just changing the port and removing the secure connection
1/6/23, 23:04 - Subhash Dixit: Do we need to create airflow account or we can use Avnish's account with the admin as username and password?
1/6/23, 23:16 - +91 93719 83850: To run the airflow service, it needs to be configured with username, password and role. It has nothing to do with Avnish's credentials. Anyone with your EC2 app link and credentials can access admin panel. You can give whatever you like. Important is to not share with anyone.
1/6/23, 23:19 - Subhash Dixit: Okay Bo. Thanks for the info. Understood now. Tell me one more thing why ec2app link is taking long tim eto open airflow and not opening many times? Is there any catch?
1/6/23, 23:22 - +91 93719 83850: Only thing that I can think of is that, free tier ec2 instance is very slow and might be taking very long time to read data from db, process it and training. It might make session to expire. That's my assumption.
1/6/23, 23:23 - Subhash Dixit: Yes that's why Avnish has created bigger machine. Is there any other way to test our application if we can not use bigger machince?
1/6/23, 23:25 - +91 93719 83850: Yeah, that's what I said about running it on local.
1/6/23, 23:26 - +91 93719 83850: Or may be try on azure with the credit you receive when logging it for the first time. You get 50usd I think.
1/6/23, 23:26 - Subhash Dixit: Yes, Okay bro you try and please let me know if you succeed.
1/6/23, 23:27 - Subhash Dixit: yes, I will try Azure once. Thank you
1/6/23, 23:28 - +91 93719 83850: But it also needs same changes and alot of security settings to connect aws ECR with azure vm.
1/6/23, 23:29 - Subhash Dixit: I need to study about deployment in depth then only I can make changes. There are lots of code.
1/7/23, 01:19 - +91 93719 83850: you can run Airflow locally by installing Docker Desktop first. Then run this command to make a docker image on the local system - "docker build -t sensor ." Mind the dot after sensor(image name). It will take 30-45 min to build a docker image based on your computer specs. Once the image is done, run this command to start container - "docker run -dp 8080:8080 sensor".
1/7/23, 01:20 - +91 93719 83850: It will atleast start airflow service & you can see the web app after login. But the pipelines will fail as it will not be able to store your model in S3 bucket.
1/7/23, 01:23 - +91 93719 83850: to see the app browse to localhost:8080

1/8/23, 21:42 - +91 96404 90672: Can anyone explain difference between  feature selection algorithms  and dimensionality reduction ??
1/8/23, 21:44 - Subhash Dixit: Features selection: you will choose features. Features will remain same , for example just that you have chosen 3 out of 5 features 
Dimensionality reduction: features are getting transformed. Final components will not be the same as initial features.
1/8/23, 21:45 - Subhash Dixit: Dimensionality reduction: you can't decide the features name because it is just transformed data
1/8/23, 22:02 - +91 96404 90672: Okay
1/8/23, 22:02 - +91 96404 90672: Thank you
